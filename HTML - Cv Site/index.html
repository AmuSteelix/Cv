  <h3>Volunteer & Leadership Experience </h3><br>
  <h5>President of Edge Hill Pokemon Society (2016-2017)</h5>
  <p>When I was selected by the previous society preseident to takeover the society, there were only two non-comittee members. This meant that I had to use my communication & leadership skills to work with my team and put changes in place to ensure the survival of the society. These changes allowed the society to see and influx in interested parties and provide a stable full-time attendance from twenty regular members and a high of between fifty to sixty members for our online platforms and events that I organised. I ensured that the society had new procedures in place for a smooth handover to the new comittee after my graduation and to help the society prosper in future years through the hard work and dedication of my hand-picked comittee.</p>
<br>
<h5>Junior Youth Leader & Youth Leader with Spring Mount Christian Fellowship (2012-2014)</h5>
<p>Prior to my move to university, I spent six years as a youth leader for Spring Mount Christian Fellowship. I would serve o the tuck-shop, handle money, cook with the children, play and organise game tournaments for various ages (a skill later adopted into my time as society president at Edge Hill University), supervised the children and ensuring we had a record of all the children in attendance. This was for two age groups; Wednesday 4pm-7pm for Primary and Friday 6pm-9pm for Secondary. </p>
